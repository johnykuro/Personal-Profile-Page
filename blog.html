        <h2>29/02/15 - SQL, Ruby Basic's and Hirigana </h2>
        <p> So I dipped my toe in the vast ocean of Back-End languages this week. I was not dissapointed. I don't think that I have mentioned this yet but I am a student of <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a> a helpful online learning platform. I am also participating in their Front-End Techdegree programme which is currently in its beta stage.</p> <p>Through a few course's available on Treehouse I tried my hand at the basics of Ruby and SQL, I'm planning to expand my knowledge futher in these language's for an upcoming personal project I have in mind. I definitley enjoyed SQL Basic's, it just seemed to flow with me and brought back fun memories of playing about with databases during I.T in school.</p>
        <p>I mentioned at the end of my last post that I am also attempting to learn Japanese. This will be my 6th week with the language and it is definitley as difficult as I expected. I have seriously started trying to memorise the Hiragana this week and have managed to work my way through the first four rows of the kana. I am still having difficulty with particles and sentence structure but I am starting to feel more confident with it all.</p>
        <p> Also I found out that my  tutor has a degree in programming so I will most likely be bombarding her with syntax questons in Japanese eventually.</p>
        
        Ciao for now.

        <h2>24/02/15 - These are the log's.. </h2>
        <p>Alas the compulsary first blog post. I have never been very good at writing anything, never mind a blog. I'm not 100&#37; sure what I'm doing here so winging it seems like the best option, usually works out ok for me.</p>
        <p>So I suppose I should introduce this blog and maybe talk a bit more about myself. I love the internet and the endless possibilities it creates, this is why I am here right know writing this post. I want to be a part of this great machine, to take those possibilities and turn them into something completly new.</p>
        <p>I suppose you can say I am one of those life-long learner types, I have been self-studying for a little while now. I like to think I have a good enough grasp of the basics to get me by &#40;Javascript is still my nemesis however&#41;. I'll be using this blog to document my progress in my studys, going over what I have been studying and linking to future projects.</p>
        <p>That's it for now anyhow.</p>
        <p>終わり &#40;I'm also attempting to learn Japanese&#41;.</p>

        <h2>Lil' Acorn's Childminding</h2>
        <p>Lil' Acorns was my first client website. The client wanted a simlpe responsive one page website which led to my decision of using Bootstap as the brick and mortar for the site. This was my first time using Bootstrap and I had a great amount of fun learning how frameworks work.</p>
        <p>I also got to play around with the basics of Google Maps Javascript API. Logo was designed by the very tallented Abigail Taylor.</p>

        <h2>University of Pymouth MMA</h2>
        <p>Occasionally I pick up the odd design job to keep my Adobe skills up to scratch. The client wanted a flyer creating to promote their Mixed Martial Arts club. The work was produced in Photosop using standard techniques for print production.</p>
        <p>Primarily used layermasks for the creation of this peice.</p>

        <h2>Grosvenor Casino, Help for Hero's</h2>
        <p>This was my first client work created with Adobe Illustrator. I had a great amount of fun with this project and was happy with the end results. I learnt a lot about creating for print and repeating patterns.</p>
        <p>Client wanted a flyer to promote a charity poker game that was being organised.</p>
